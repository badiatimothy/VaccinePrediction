# VaccinePrediction
This is a simple machine learning project in order to predict when the COVID-19 vaccination will be completed as it reaches the target amount. As we know that we can see from https://vaksin.kemkes.go.id/#/vaccines that contains real-time vaccination information in Indonesia, and attached 208,265,720 as the target amount. Indonesian's population in 2019 was about 270,600,000. Based on 2019 data, the target is about 76.96% from total of 2019 Indonesian's population.  This tells us that at least more than 3/4 of Indonesian's population have to be vaccinated so that will leads the government to take new policies and decisions.
